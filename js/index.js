Ink Joakim Soria to re-create the three-headed bullpen monster. Reclamation projects play a sizable role in the 2015 team’s success? Re-sign Chris Young, then buy low on Dillon Gee and Travis Snider. Wait patiently for years until Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Lorenzo Cain and Alcides Escobar grow into impact players? Bring them (and Alex Gordon) all back for another run. Teams that (mostly) stand pat after winning it all tend to see significant declines the following season, and the projection systems see that happening with the Royals. But if you’re going to buck that trend, doing so with a core group of players in their 20s, and a high-contact offense/impenetrable bullpen approach that’s crushed expectations two years in a row, could be a good way to give it a shot.',

		prediction: 'One of Bill James’s lasting contributions to the field of analytics is the Plexiglas Principle. Related to the broader idea of regression toward the mean, the Plexiglas Principle posits that teams or players coming off a big jump (or drop) in performance one year tend to edge back toward the middle the following season. The Astros gained 16 games in the standings in 2015, going from an also-ran to a playoff team. That would seem to make them prime Plexiglas candidates, yet I don’t see that happening here. A full season of shortstop wunderkind Carlos Correa will be electric and add at least a couple more wins to Houston’s ledger. Only two members of the projected lineup are over 30, and by only a few months: Carlos Gomez and likely platoon guy Luis Valbuena. The rotation got a back-end bargain with the addition of Doug Fister for just $7 million plus incentives, and the bullpen should benefit from the off-season trade for young flamethrowing closer Ken Giles. Add to that GM Jeff Luhnow’s demonstrated willingness to get aggressive at the deadline, and the Astros’ first division title in 15 years is very much in play.',

Then you pick up a capable swingman in Jesse Chavez to add depth. Then you trade for Drew Storen, upgrading the bullpen. Add a full season of Marcus Stroman, and optimism over Aaron Sanchez likely claiming the fifth starter role, and you have a Jays staff that has a chance to make up for the loss of Price ... or more precisely, the two months of Price that they had last year.

In 2016 they’ll get a full season from Hamels, potentially 25 starts from Yu Darvish, and 22-year-old rising star second baseman Rougned Odor with another year of experience under his belt.

Spending top dollar for premium starting pitching perfectly fits the traditional mandate put forth by new GM Dave Dombrowski in his previous gigs. Mookie Betts and Xander Bogaerts are budding stars, fellow homegrown prospects Jackie Bradley Jr. and Blake Swihart could be primed for mini-breakouts, and there’s more young talent on the way with lefty starter Henry Owens, infielder Deven Marrero and others poised to contribute at some point this season.

You have to take the under on Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira hitting 64 homers again. Meanwhile, Carlos Beltran’s defense is so bad in rightfield that he shouldn’t be playing anywhere other than DH, a position that A-Rod currently occupies. The addition of Aroldis Chapman gives the Yanks a ludicrously great bullpen, and the young quartet of Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda, Nathan Eovaldi and Luis Severino is highly underrated.

Expect the M’s to win more close games this season thanks to a relief corps that should be much better than 2015’s sorry group.

Add to that a starting rotation that could be much improved with the additions of Wade Miley and Nathan Karns, plus the possibility of a huge breakout for 23-year-old Taijuan Walker.

The projected rotation should go a long way toward meeting that first goal, with Chris Archer leading a potentially electric starting five. For goal No. 2, the Rays will lean on platoons and time-shares.

For all the help those veterans should provide, this is still a team with youth at many key positions, which is exactly what you want in the (mostly) post-PED era, when age curves have changed and players tend to peak earlier and fall off more sharply. The 2015 rookie class of Kris Bryant, Addison Russell and THE SCHWARBS could inflict serious damage on opponents. And that’s before we get to Anthony Rizzo, who’s just 26, and Heyward, who even entering his seventh major league season is actually one day younger than Rizzo. Having the best team on paper guarantees nothing, with lesser clubs able to get hot at the right time and roll to the World Series.

Add Cespedes’s return with a revamped middle infield that now includes Neil Walker and Asdrubal Cabrera, as well as potentially exciting things from catcher Travis d’Arnaud and outfielder Michael Conforto over a full season, and the Mets offense could be beastly. That’s a scary proposition for the rest of the league, given what the team’s biggest strength still is: a terrifying rotation that could be even deeper this year, with Zack Wheeler eyeing a possible July return from Tommy John surgery. There is an Achilles heel here, with Walker, Cabrera and Cespedes likely to deliver some ugly defense up the middle.
